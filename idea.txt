A module based program for monitoring different things:

 - Proccess Monitor
 - incoming, outgoing connections (TCP, UDP)
 - port scanner
 - event scanner (correlation engine)

Module based, every thing is a module
Interface based, for dependency injection too

IModule:
    load_module() -> loads the module into list of modules
    start_module() -> starts the module (e.g procmon will take continuous snapshots )
    stop_module() -> stop_module() stops the module from doing its job
    unload_module() -> after finished using module, module will be unloaded from memory


multithreading-> every module is run on a separate thread so that they can run concurrently

process monitor needs to take a snapshot of all running processes -> ProcSnapshot
enumerate all proccesses into Process, object describing a process

IProcess -> LinuxProcess | WinProcess


ProcMonModule
NetMonModule
PortScanModule
EventScanModule

OS abstraction
